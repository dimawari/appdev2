## 1. What went well
- I get to understand the first part(s) of the AppDev 1 and I think it's actually fun to learn if you're not in your burnout season and if the time is not one of the constaints.
- It's still giving me shivers upon knowing that what we've encountered in AppDev 1 is merely the basics of a real-world profession so I think it's a good point.

## 2. What went wrong / Challenges
- Honestly speaking, programming/coding was never my forte so I really struggled understanding the technicalities of React.
- I think I suddenly went to "go with the flow" attitude since I can't keep up anymore which is not good at all. 
- Too much attitude, difficulty in expressing what I really meant.

## 3. Key Learnings
- With AppDev 1, I happened to know more about myself---my strengths, weaknesses, good and bad traits in a team setting. Also, I learnt that we can't choose people we would like to work with but we can choose how to present ourselves around them and make the other's burden lighter even just a tad bit.
- Also, aiming for one role is not enough (at least for me). You can be a jack-of-all-trades if you want (I want it at some point) so that you can be the person you once needed in a group.
- You can't win at everything but you can try (-With a Smile // Eraserheads).

## 4. Areas for Improvement
- More practice of what have been taught, not just passive listening. 
- Enhance **CSS and layout skills**, especially for responsive designs.  
- Work on **time management** to avoid last-minute issues during group projects.  
- Work on my courage to try things out of my comfort zone.

## 5. Expectations for Mobile Development (AppDev2)
- I hope to learn **React Native fundamentals** and how to adapt our web project into a mobile app.  
- I want to understand **Expo tools**, mobile navigation, and best practices for mobile UI/UX.  
- I aim to become comfortable with **TypeScript** as we transition from JavaScript.
